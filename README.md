# Mapping Food Deserts in Englewood, Chicago

## Project Overview

This project aims to visualize and analyze food access disparities in Englewood, a neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. Englewood is a well-documented food desert, where residents face significant challenges accessing healthy and affordable food. This project will use publicly available data to map food access, income levels, and other relevant factors to identify areas of greatest need.

## Geographic Scope

This project focuses on the Englewood neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois.

## Project Goals

* Visualize the spatial distribution of food deserts in Englewood.
* Analyze the relationship between income levels and food access.
* Identify areas with limited access to grocery stores and fresh produce.

## Data Sources

* USDA Food Access Research Atlas (https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/go-to-the-atlas) 

## Methodology (Initial Outline)

This project will use Python with the Pandas, Geopandas, and Folium libraries for data analysis and visualization. Spatial analysis will be conducted to calculate distances to grocery stores and identify food deserts. Data from the USDA Food Access Research Atlas and the U.S. Census Bureau will be integrated and analyzed.

## Getting Started/Installation

Instructions will be added later.
